# Tank
a DIY tank project of mine... in works since October '18!

joyFinal.py:  includes snippets to get data from Switch Pro controller, outputs right analog
              stick data to pitch servo (Parallax Standard Servo) and yaw servo (Parallax 
              Continuous Rotation Servo). Body of turret has yet to be designed and 3D
              printed.
